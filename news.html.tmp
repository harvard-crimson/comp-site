					The News Board is the heart and soul of The Crimson. From bombs in Boston to fabricated bomb threats by students, we report the stories that the Harvard community and the public want to read. Writers on the News Board have access to top University officials and get to see their bylines run in our newspaper, printed day in and day out. To boot, we are a committed, close-knit community that extends from our undergraduate days to long past commencement.
