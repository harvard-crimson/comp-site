        The News Board is the heart and soul of The Crimson. From the College&rsquo;s unprecedented sanctions on final clubs, fraternities and sororities, to the historic search for Harvard&rsquo;s 29th president, the Crimson News Board is frequently at the center of campus conversations. We receive early access to admissions data and conduct exclusive interviews with Harvard&rsquo;s top administrators. Writers get to see their bylines run in our daily newspaper and on our award-winning website which receives more than 1.5 million page views per month. We are a committed, close-knit community that extends from our undergraduate days to long past graduation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We encourage anyone who wants to hone their communication skills, learn effective writing, think analytically, or work as a team to comp the News Board!
      </p>
      <p>
        Our writers learn how to ask the right questions and get answers. They learn how to investigate and organize facts into writing. No previous experience in journalism is necessary: the comp process is designed to provide students with all the skills necessary for becoming a reporter.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the comp, students are expected to:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Attend weekly comp seminars
          </li>
          <li>
            Write eight daily stories
          </li>
          <li>
            Write one feature
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Come and join the ranks of The Crimson&rsquo;s most prestigious board, which has produced the likes of presidents and Pulitzer Prize winners.
