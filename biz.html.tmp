					Who makes this paper a million-dollar business? We do. Come see how you can help, and eventually transform, your chosen field. Advertising, Circulation, Contract Printing, and Operations are waiting for you!
				</p>
				<p>
					The Harvard Crimson Business Board is the premier business experience on campus. Our editors gain hands-on experience from Day One, and go on to obtain some of the most competitive business, finance and consulting positions.
				</p>

				<p>Google? Check.</p>

				<p>Goldman Sachs? Check.</p>

				<p>McKinsey? Check.</p>

				<p>
					We train you in the skills you need to succeed both on and off campus&mdash;and give you the network to leverage those skills.
				</p>

				<p>
					The culture of the Business Board has always proven unique and invigorating. Friendships are formed from the first day of the comp, and you&rsquo;ll find a closely-knit community, with fellow editors ready to offer advice and help on anything you need.
				</p>
				<p>
					We work hard and play harder. Join the comp to find out for yourself!
				</p>
				<p>
					The Business comp is not for the weak, but hey, we are a real business. It will be hard at times, but you&rsquo;ll learn a lot. And your resume will gain a couple really impressive lines: Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to hire a guy who sold $100,000 in advertisements as a college freshman?
				</p>
				<p>
					Comp requirements cover all five departments in order to give you an appropriate exposure and a great variety of skills. Mandatory weekly meetings on Sunday evenings from 7 to 8 PM introduce you to the theory behind different aspects of the business, which you can then apply during regular business hours while interacting with our many clients or working on high-impact projects. Once elected to the board, you will be able to specialize in one department and shape it as you wish.
				</p>
				<p>
					So let&rsquo;s cut to the chase&mdash;you should comp Business.
