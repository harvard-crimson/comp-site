Regardless of your passion, we have ten different boards, 12 different comps, and {{ site.num_years_crimson_existed }} years of experience waiting for you at 14 Plympton St. The Crimson is not only the nation&rsquo;s oldest continuously published daily newspaper and the only breakfast-table daily newspaper in Cambridge, Mass., but it is also the premier student organization at Harvard College, offering opportunities in everything from journalism to business to photography</p>

      <p>Don&#39;t believe us?</p>
      <p>Consider the long list of Crimson alumni whose names you already know. U.S. Presidents Roosevelt &rsquo;1904 and Kennedy &rsquo;40. Legendary Pulitzer prize-winning journalists Anthony Lewis &rsquo;48, Nicholas D. Kristof &rsquo;81 (both of whom won it twice), Linda Greenhouse &rsquo;68, and David Sanger &rsquo;82. And titans of business, media, and technology, such as Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer &rsquo;77, Washington Post Publisher Don Graham &rsquo;65, and <em>Mad Money</em> host Jim Cramer &rsquo;77, just to name a few.</p>
      <p>Still not sure?</p>
      <p>Consider The Crimson&rsquo;s magnitude and reach as a newspaper and a company. Its million-dollar business. Its website that, in {{ site.year | minus: 1 }}, got {{ site.yearly_page_views_millions }} million pageviews. Its Financial Aid Program that has given out close to $1 million over the past decade. There are few other chances to be a part of something this big, far-reaching, or relevant.

      <p>Come see for yourself! We will have three open houses this year at our building (14 Plympton St., just north of Adams House, and just south of Mass. Ave.):</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Open House for All Boards: Feb. 3, 2019, 7 p.m. - 8:30 p.m.</li>
        <li>Tech, Design, and Multimedia Open House: Feb. 4, 2019, 7 p.m. - 8:30 p.m.</li>
        <li>Open House for All Boards: Feb. 5, 2019, 7 p.m. - 8:30 p.m.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>FINANCIAL AID</h3>
      <p>Worried that you won&#39;t be able to spend time on The Crimson because you think you&#39;ll need a paying job? We can help. The Crimson&#39;s Financial Aid Program offers limited but substantial compensation to staff members with demonstrated financial need. It&#39;s meant to ensure that students who would otherwise need a term-time job can be Crimson editors, and it&#39;s part of our efforts to make sure that all Harvard students have the opportunity to enjoy and learn from the experience of working here, regardless of their socioeconomic background.</p>
      <p>Any questions? Want more information? Don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact Crimson President {{ site.president }} (<a href="mailto:president@thecrimson.com">president@thecrimson.com</a>) with any and all questions about the program.</p>
