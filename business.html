      <p>Who makes this paper a million-dollar business? We do.</p>
      <p>The Harvard Crimson Business Board is the premier business experience on campus. Our associates gain hands-on experience managing a business from day one, and go on to obtain some of the most competitive business, finance, and consulting positions.</p>
      <p>Google? Check.</p>
      <p>Goldman Sachs? Check.</p>
      <p>McKinsey? Check.</p>
      <p>We train you in the skills you need to succeed both on and off campus&mdash;and give you the network to leverage those skills. And your resume will gain a couple really impressive lines: Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to hire a guy who sold $100,000 in advertisements as a college freshman?</p>
      <p>The culture of the Business Board has always proven unique and invigorating. Friendships are formed from the first day of the comp, and you&rsquo;ll find a closely-knit community, with fellow associates ready to offer advice and help on anything you need. Whether you ask associates who comped their freshman fall, or those who comped their sophomore spring, they&rsquo;ll tell you how close of a family Crimson Business really is.</p>
      <p>Any questions? Want more information? Don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact our Directors of Staff Development, {% include comp_director.html director=site.business.dir1 %} and {% include comp_director.html director=site.business.dir2 %} with any and all questions and concerns, or visit our website, <a href="business.thecrimson.com">business.thecrimson.com</a> for more details.</p>
