					&ldquo;We know what art is! It&#39;s paintings of horses!&rdquo;

					The Arts Board of The Crimson is responsible for covering artistic events, whether they take place on campus, in Boston, or on the national stage. From reviewing shows before they hit Broadway to sitting down for an interview with Will Ferrell, the Arts Board of The Crimson offers writers and compers an array of unique opportunities&mdash;all of them totally free.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our comp is designed to teach you everything you will need to know as a writer, from interviewing techniques to crafting a perfect lede. We welcome everyone regardless of your level of previous experience with journalism. In addition to our seminars and meetings, we also hold Happy Hours and other social events to let you get to know our writers and execs. In addition to giving writers free access to a ton of amazing events, the Arts Board of The Crimson is also just a great group of people, and if you&#39;d like to join us, we&#39;d love to have you.

					Want to know more? Awesome! Here&#39;s what you&#39;ll have to write in order to be elected to the Arts Board:
					<ul>
						<li>
							2 reviews (reviews of movies, albums, books, theater, and exhibits)
						</li>

						</li>
					</ul>

				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to writing articles, compers must attend our weekly comp seminars at 6 p.m. on Mondays in the Sanctum (i.e., directly before Writers&#39; Meetings). At these seminars we&#39;ll teach you everything you need to know about arts writing, even if you have never written a complete sentence. We&#39;ll also have fun.
				</p>
				<p>
					Did you start comping arts but got distracted? It&#39;s cool. We&#39;ve kept track of everything you&#39;ve already written and the articles still count towards your comp. Come back soon. We miss you.
