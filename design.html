        This year, we’re offering three tracks: print, web, and illustration. Regardless of your interest, the Design Board has a place for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Print Design</strong> comp will teach you how to create an eye-catching front page or a gorgeous magazine spread. After the comp, you’ll be responsible for the professional presentation of The Crimson’s publications, including the front and feature pages of the daily paper, the arts supplement, and the FM magazine. We lay out pages and prepare all graphs and graphics. Print Design will host an <strong>open-to-all <a href="https://forms.gle/VQFVLBB3PzoP5AZ98">Animations Workshop</a></strong> on January 29th for anyone interested in getting a taste of what we do.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Web Design</strong> collaborates closely with the Tech board to ensure that The Crimson's website is user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing for our online readers. Web designers work extensively with the design software Figma, while also constantly trying to improve all users' experiences on thecrimson.com. By developing skills ranging from hand-drawn sketches to wire framing to unveiling a final product, Web Design compers will become very familiar with the process behind designing a website from scratch.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Illustration</strong> gives artists a platform to create original artwork and enhance writing from across The Crimson with strong visual storytelling. Illustrators learn a range of skills and techniques, including digital illustration, watercolor, marker, and pen. They exercise a lot of flexibility, whether they're creating standalone cartoons or working hand-in-hand with Editorial, Arts, and FM.
      </p>
      <p>
        All three tracks involve weekly meetings, training sessions with design editors, exercises, and social events within the Design Board and The Harvard Crimson. Compers will complete both exercises and projects that allow them to showcase their new design skills and knowledge, as well as real published designs with the guidance of editors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Design Comp is focused on you and on developing a great relationship between you and the editors on the board. You will not only gain practical skills, but also an immediate social and professional network.
