					Are you hilarious? Witty? Mildly interesting to be around? If any of these apply to you, Blog is the place to be. We cover a variety of content, from <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/series/roving-reporter/article/2013/4/13/hammonds-tyga-roving-reporter/">Roving Reporter videos</a> to <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/series/the-housing-market-2013/">House rankings</a> to posts dedicated to our one and only <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/9/23/pfister-sends-own-emails/">Interim Dean Pfister</a> (which we recently learned he enjoys reading!). Blog is one of the most well-read sections of The Crimson, and our posts have been picked up by national and international news outlets.

					<strong><a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/section/flyby/">Flyby</a></strong> is the flagship blog of the Crimson and covers student life&mdash;we follow all things happening on campus, from <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/9/24/lines-leaving-lamont/">Lamont</a> to <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/series/flybys-final-club-survey/article/2013/10/2/final-club-demographics/">the Spee</a>, and allow you to write about what most interests you.

					Whatever your interests (journalism, satire, Andre, etc.), Blog will give you the space, training, and support to develop your own creative passions at 14p&mdash;just so long as it doesn&#39;t involve actual paper. But don&#39;t worry: we&#39;ll have gifs.
