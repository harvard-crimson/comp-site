					Welcome to the Spring 2015 Comp of The Harvard Crimson. Whatever your passion is, we have nine different boards and 142 years of experience waiting for you at 14 Plympton St. The Crimson is not only the nation&#39;s oldest continuously published daily newspaper and the only breakfast-table daily newspaper in Cambridge, Mass., it&#39;s also the premier student organization at Harvard College, offering transformative experiences in everything from journalism, to advertising, to photography&mdash;the list goes on.

				</p>
				<p>
					Don&#39;t believe us?
				</p>
				<p>
					Consider the long list of Crimson alumni whose names you already know. U.S. Presidents Roosevelt &rsquo;1904 and Kennedy &rsquo;40. Legendary Pulitzer prize-winning journalists Anthony Lewis &rsquo;48, Nicholas D. Kristof &rsquo;81 (both of whom won it twice), Linda Greenhouse &rsquo;68, and David Sanger &rsquo;82. And titans of business, media, and technology, such as Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer &rsquo;77, Washington Post Publisher Don Graham &rsquo;65, and <em>Mad Money</em> host Jim Cramer &rsquo;77, just to name a few.
				</p>
				<p>
					Still not sure?
				</p>
				<p>
					Consider The Crimson&rsquo;s magnitude and reach as a newspaper and a company. Its million-dollar business. Its website that, in 2013, got 15 million pageviews. There are few other chances to be a part of something this big, far-reaching, or relevant.
				</p>
				<p>
					Not convinced?
				</p>
				<p>
					Come see for yourself!
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>General Open Houses:</strong><br>Monday, September 8 and Tuesday, Semptember 9 from 7-8:30 p.m.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Tech + Web Design:</strong><br>Thursday, September 10 from 7-8:30 p.m.

				<h3>
					FINANCIAL AID
				</h3>
				<p>
					Worried that you won&#39;t be able to spend time on The Crimson because you think you&#39;ll need a paying job? We can help. The Crimson&#39;s Financial Aid Program offers limited but substantial compensation to staff members with demonstrated financial need. It&#39;s meant to ensure that students who would otherwise need a term-time job can participate in The Crimson, and it&#39;s part of our efforts to make sure that all Harvard students have the opportunity to enjoy and learn from the experience of working here, regardless of socioeconomic background.
				</p>
				<p>
					Students may contact <a href="mailto:president@thecrimson.com">president@thecrimson.com</a> with questions about the program.
