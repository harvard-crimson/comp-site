				<p>
					Welcome to the {{ comp.season }} {{ comp.year }} comp for The Harvard Crimson! Regardless of your passion, we have ten different boards, 12 different comps, and {{ comp.num_years_crimson_existed }} years of experience waiting for you at 14 Plympton St. The Crimson is not only the nation&rsquo;s oldest continuously published daily newspaper and the only breakfast-table daily newspaper in Cambridge, Mass., but it is also the premier student organization at Harvard College, offering transformative experiences in everything from journalism to advertising to photography&mdash;the list goes on.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a target="_blank" href="{{ comp.google_doc_signup }}">Sign up to comp here</a>, and be sure to RSVP on Facebook.
				</p>
				<p>
					Don&#39;t believe us?
				</p>
				<p>
					Consider the long list of Crimson alumni whose names you already know. U.S. Presidents Roosevelt &rsquo;1904 and Kennedy &rsquo;40. Legendary Pulitzer prize-winning journalists Anthony Lewis &rsquo;48, Nicholas D. Kristof &rsquo;81 (both of whom won it twice), Linda Greenhouse &rsquo;68, and David Sanger &rsquo;82. And titans of business, media, and technology, such as Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer &rsquo;77, Washington Post Publisher Don Graham &rsquo;65, and <em>Mad Money</em> host Jim Cramer &rsquo;77, just to name a few.
				</p>
				<p>
					Still not sure?
				</p>
				<p>
					Consider The Crimson&rsquo;s magnitude and reach as a newspaper and a company. Its million-dollar business. Its website that, in {{ comp.year - 1 }}, got {{ comp.yearly_page_views_millions }} million pageviews (meaning readers spent {{ comp.yearly_page_time_spent_years }} years on <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/">thecrimson.com</a> last year). There are few other chances to be a part of something this big, far-reaching, or relevant.
				</p>
				<p>
					Not convinced?
				</p>
				<p>
					Come see for yourself! Our open houses will be at our building (14 Plympton St., just north of Adams House, and just south of Mass. Ave.) on {{ comp.open_house }}.
				</p>
				<h3>
					FINANCIAL AID
				</h3>
				<p>
					Worried that you won&#39;t be able to spend time on The Crimson because you think you&#39;ll need a paying job? We can help. The Crimson&#39;s Financial Aid Program offers limited but substantial compensation to staff members with demonstrated financial need. It&#39;s meant to ensure that students who would otherwise need a term-time job can be Crimson editors, and it&#39;s part of our efforts to make sure that all Harvard students have the opportunity to enjoy and learn from the experience of working here, regardless of their socioeconomic background.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any questions? Want more information? Don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact Crimson President {{ comp.president }} (<a href="mailto:president@thecrimson.com">president@thecrimson.com</a>) any and all questions about the program.
