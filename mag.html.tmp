					&ldquo;In the future, everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes.&rdquo; &mdash; Andy Warhol
				</p>
				<p>
					We can&rsquo;t predict how you&rsquo;ll get famous, but we can promise you&rsquo;ll look good doing it. Comp Fifteen Minutes, the Crimson&rsquo;s weekly magazine, and hang out with the Cool Kids<sup>TM</sup> of 14 Plympton St.
				</p>
				<p>
					We publish The Crimson&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/11/17/sexually-explicit-guide-to-MIT-men/">sexiest content</a>, from profiles of <a href="http://features.thecrimson.com/2016/fifteen-seniors/">quirky campus figures</a> to captivating <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/11/10/boston-strikebreakers/">retrospections</a>, with a little <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/9/18/eulogy-for-a-sandwich/">levity</a> in between. Sometimes, we don&rsquo;t drink <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/4/7/not-absinthe/">absinthe</a>. Every once in a while, we talk about our <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/10/20/pandas-are-scary/">feelings<a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Oh, and we almost forgot: <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/9/29/harvard-undocumented-scrut/">scrutinies</a>. They&rsquo;re our weekly <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/10/27/hillary-i-presume/">cover stories</a>, and consistently rank among the <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/10/30/stanford-vs-harvard/">most-read</a> articles on The Crimson&rsquo;s website. If you&rsquo;re looking to flex your investigative reporting muscles, look no further.
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; you might say. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any investigative reporting muscles! I&rsquo;ve never written a magazine article in my life!&rdquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					That&rsquo;s where we come in: you&rsquo;ll join us for weekly comp seminars and staff writers&rsquo; meetings on Monday evenings, and you&rsquo;ll learn everything you need to know about writing for FM, from interview basics to structure and style. You&rsquo;ll refine your articles with brilliant editors and in turn, we hope, grow immensely as a writer.
				</p>
				<p>
					FM lends critical eyes and surprising angles to timely news threads. When News writers were reporting live from the HUDS picket lines, we were <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/10/13/huds-strike-scrutiny/">at home with dining workers</a>, meeting the family members they were fighting to support. When President Obama nominated Harvard alum Merrick Garland &rsquo;77 to the Supreme Court, we called up his college roommates and learned about his <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/4/17/merrick-garland-harvard/">sick karate moves</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					At FM, we do a lot more than sit around and look cool. (Although we do a fair amount of that too.) We want you to join us.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any questions? Want more information? Don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact our Fifteen Minutes Comp Directors, {{ comp.magazine.dir1|comp_director }} and {{ comp.magazine.dir2|comp_director }} with any and all questions and concerns.
