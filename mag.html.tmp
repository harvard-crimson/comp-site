					If you&#39;ve ever wanted to write articles but aren&#39;t sure where among News, Arts, Sports, or Editorial your interests align, look no further than <b>Fifteen Minutes</b>, the Crimson&#39;s weekly magazine. FM&#39;s content ranges from short, humorous pieces to in-depth profiles and features: it's a veritable cornucopia of content. Oh, and we almost forgot: scrutinies. They&#39;re our weekly cover stories, and consistently rank among the most read articles on Crimson website. One word, three syllables: exposure.

					There are a number of reasons you should comp Fifteen Minutes. We have the most freeform pieces, giving you ample opportunity to experiment and grow as a writer. Ask any writer who&#39;s comped multiple boards of the Crimson, and he/she will tell you that the FM comp is by far the most enjoyable. You&#39;re going to interact with other writers who are fascinated with their craft, and you&#39;re going to learn from them&mdash;whether you like it or not. We really hope you will.
