					If you&#39;ve ever wanted to write articles but aren&#39;t sure where among News, Arts, Sports, or Editorial your interests align, look no further than <b>Fifteen Minutes</b>, the Crimson&#39;s weekly magazine. FM&#39;s content ranges from short, humorous pieces to in-depth profiles and features: it's a veritable cornucopia of content. Oh, and we almost forgot: scrutinies. They&#39;re our weekly cover stories, and consistently rank among the most read articles on Crimson website. One word, three syllables: exposure.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are a number of reasons you should comp Fifteen Minutes. We have the most freeform pieces, giving you ample opportunity to experiment and grow as a writer. Ask any writer who&#39;s comped multiple boards of the Crimson, and he/she will tell you that the FM comp is by far the most enjoyable. You&#39;re going to interact with other writers who are fascinated with their craft, and you&#39;re going to learn from them&mdash;whether you like it or not. We really hope you will.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here's what you'll have to write to be elected to the FM board:
					<ul>
						<li>
							6 FM articles (where you&#39;ll be trying out some different forms of pieces)
						</li>
						<li>
							1 News article
						</li>
						<li>
							1 Blog post
						</li>
						<li>
							1 Research assist (transcribing an interview)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					You&#39;ll also be joining us for our weekly comp seminars, which happen on Mondays before Writer&#39;s Meetings. They are super fun, and you will learn everything you need to know about writing for FM.
				</p>
