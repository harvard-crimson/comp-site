        The Arts Board of The Crimson is responsible for — believe it or not — writing about art.
      </p>
      <p>
        We write about <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/8/17/folklore-album-review-article/">Taylor Swift</a> and <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/11/19/frozen-2-review/">‘Frozen 2’</a> and <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/21/ezra-miller-scandal/">Ezra Miller&#39;s choking scandal</a> and <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/1/24/bieber-yummy-mv-is-upsetting/">Justin Beiber&#39;s music video for ‘Yummy’</a> and, essentially, anything and everything going on in the world of art and pop culture. We also cover Harvard’s arts scene: from <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/14/man-of-the-year-ben-platt/">Ben Platt&#39;s “Man of the Year” celebration</a> to the <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/6/Hasty-Pudding-Theatricals-Mean-Ghouls-Review/">Hasty Pudding&#39;s yearly musical comedy</a> to the <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/3/26/handel-and-haydn-orchestra-beethoven-review/">Handel and Haydn&#39;s society&#39;s latest performance</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re interested in film, TV, music, books, theater—really anything that you can consume with your eyes or ears—the Arts Board is for you!
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from being a part of the wonderful, idiosyncratic, and outrageously witty community that is the Arts Board, there are plenty of other perks to comping as well! Our writers have attended the <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/topic/cannes-2019/">Cannes Film Festival</a>, sat down to <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/3/20/casa-de-mi-padre-ferrell/">interview Will Ferrell</a>, and regularly get tickets to movie screenings, music performances, and guest speaker events—all free of charge.
      </p>
      <p>
        We, like all Crimson boards, welcome everyone regardless of prior journalism experience. Our comp is designed to teach you everything you will need to know as a writer, from interviewing techniques to crafting a perfect lede. All you need to do is show up—and write!
      <p>
        <h4 style="margin-bottom: 5px; text-decoration: underline;">Requirements</h4>
        We&#39;ll go over all of these at our first meeting, but in case you&#39;re curious, here&#39;s what you&#39;ll need to write to become a writer for Crimson Arts:
        <ul>
          <li>
            2 reviews (reviews of movies, albums, books, theater, and exhibits)
          </li>
          <li>
            2 features (longer pieces that do not fall under the category of criticism—e.g., interviews)
          </li>
          <li>
            1 additional feature or review
          </li>
          <li>
            2 additional pieces for Arts
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Articles are pitched out by editors at our weekly Writers&#39; Meetings, which take place on Mondays at 7 p.m.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to writing articles, compers must attend our weekly comp seminars at 6 p.m. on Mondays(i.e., directly before Writers&#39; Meetings). At these seminars we&#39;ll teach you everything you need to know about arts writing, even if you have never written a complete sentence. We&#39;ll also have fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Did you start comping arts but got distracted? It&#39;s cool. We&#39;ve kept track of everything you&#39;ve already written and the articles still count towards your comp. Come back soon. We miss you.
