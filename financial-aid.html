        Worried that you won't be able to spend time on The Crimson because you think you'll need a paying job? We can help. The Crimson's Financial Aid Program offers limited but substantial compensation to staff members with demonstrated financial need. It's meant to ensure that students who would otherwise need a term-time job can be Crimson editors, and it's part of our efforts to make sure that all Harvard students have the opportunity to enjoy and learn from the experience of working here, regardless of their socioeconomic background.
