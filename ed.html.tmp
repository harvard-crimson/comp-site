					Founded in 1911, the Editorial Board is the premier platform for opining at Harvard. We discuss everything from CS50 to global health initiatives, and if you like reading, writing, or just hearing yourself talk, we invite you to comp the Ed Board this semester! Comping the Editorial Board is the best way to have your opinions published in The Crimson, so comp Ed if you want your voice heard on campus and beyond.
				</p>
				<p>
					Compers will learn to hone their writing and public speaking abilities as we discuss and opine on some of today&rsquo;s most pressing issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any questions? Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact our comp directors, Kevin Hazlett and Christina Teodorescu, at <a href="mailto:khazlett472@gmail.com">khazlett472@gmail.com</a> and <a href="mailto:christina.teodorescu@thecrimson.com">christina.teodorescu@thecrimson.com</a>.
